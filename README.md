# geo-chat
This project is missing parts of a few key files, as they contain API keys that I'd rather not have public

You can demo the app here: https://geo-chatters.web.app/
> A Vue.js project

When you first visit the app, you will be prompted to either login or signup.  Once authorized, your browser will certainly ask for geolocation permission.

The map will then focus on your location and drop a waypoint.  You can explore the map and find other waypoints, which represent other users.  

When one of the way points is clicked, you can see that user's wall, where you can leave a comment.
